About my website:
    There I use a total of four API's to get the world's countries, the country's regions, and the regions cities. I then get the weather for the chosen city.


Extras:
1. Hid API keys
2. Because I wasn't thrilled with the images returned by Pexels, I manually chose images and stored them in an array.
    *** Note - I appear to be experiencing major problems with using local/session storage. It writes to it, but will not update. If I can't fix it I'll have to go back to random images, which are not visually appealing.

I would have also had liked to:
1. Add an auto suggest for the dropdown(s).
2. Added travel advisories.
