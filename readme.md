About my website
It is a one page blog that contains 49 unique topics that fall into seven categories. If the user's input passes validation, each topic will store an array of headings, text, and an image in local storage and immediately display it to the user once submitted. There is no hardcoded data in this application.

Extras:
1. Hid API keys

I would have also had liked to:
1. Add an auto suggest for the dropdown(s).
2. Added travel advisories.
